Excited to share my latest project — WesternSphere!
 A scalable, microservices-based internship & job portal built using Spring Boot, JWT, Eureka, MySQL, Cloudinary, and Razorpay.
💡 Features Include:
 ●Role-based access for Admin, Recruiters, and Students
 ●JWT-secured authentication
 ●Resume uploads and media management via Cloudinary
 ●Razorpay-integrated billing & PDF invoice generation
 ●Microservices communication using Eureka
🔧 This was a hands-on learning experience in building production-grade backend systems with modular architecture and real-world integrations.
